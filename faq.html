    Onix Client FAQ
    </h1>
    <p>Onix Client is a legit modification for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Sometimes, you may need help setting it up, and this is what the FAQ is for. This has all of the common questions about Onix Client, installation, and usage. If you have any suggestions for this page, please fork this repository, edit it, and then create a pull request. Finally, if you have any other questions please join the Discord server and create a ticket there. <strong>Note: Before using the client make sure you agree with the Onix Client License which is found at the bottom of this page or <a href="https://ocwebsite.github.io/license.html">here</a>.</strong> </p>
    <h2>üì™ Where can I download Onix Client?</h2>
    <p>To download Onix Client, go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/945387005775323226/">#download</a> channel. Once you do this, you have a few options:</p>
    <h4>Launcher (Recommended)</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>Download the launcher and open it. Once you click launch, after a few seconds, it will automatically open your game and inject Onix Client.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Injector & DLL</h3>
    <ul>
       <p>Use the Onix Injector and download the DLL. Select the DLL. Then, open Minecraft and go back into the injector. Once Minecraft loads, click Inject.</p>
       <p>You CAN use a third-party injector, but we can't ensure that it will work properly and if it&#39;s safe for public use.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Is Onix Client safe?</h2>
    <p>Yes, we can assure you that Onix Client is 100% safe for use. Your antivirus might flag it because it injects a DLL into the game. However, due note these things:</p>
    <ul>
       <p>Our injector can only inject into Minecraft, other viruses attack other applications, if not all.<br>
       If you use any third-party program along with our DLL, we are <strong>NOT</strong> ensuring functionality or the fact that this is safe. However, any Onix Client file used is 100% safe.<br>
       Minecraft is a UWP app, which means it is sandboxed. Meaning even if the DLL was malicious, it wouldn't be able to do very much when injected into the minecraft process. More info about UWP sandboxing <a href="https://labs.sogeti.com/windows-store-apps-live-sandbox">Here</a>.<br>
       If you ever feel like anything is not safe, <strong>DON'T</strong> use it.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>What devices does Onix Client support?</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>You have to use Windows 10/11. You also need the 64-bit operating system with an x64-based processor.</p>
        <p>This shouldn't be a problem if you have Windows 11, as an x64-based processor is required to use it.</p>
        <h4>How do i check?</h4>
        <ul>
        	<p>Right click the Start button and click "System", which takes you to this screen:</p>
            <p> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/140582244-70a847bf-a2fb-41dc-ae0c-320090bbf23e.png" alt=""></p>
            <li>If it says <code>64-bit operating system, x64-based processor</code>, you can use Onix Client.</li>
            <li>If it says <code>32-bit operating system, x64-based processor</code>, you need to install the 64-bit version of Windows. We will not be showing you how to do that here, so go do your research.</li>
            <li>If it says <code>32-bit operating system, <strong><em>x86</em></strong>-based processor</code>, unfortunately, you can't use Onix Client.</li>
            <li>If your PC is ARM or Qualcomm based, you can't use Onix Client either.</li>
         </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>We have no plans to support any devices other than Windows PCs. Don&#39;t ask for it.</strong></h3>
    <br><br>
    <h3>The launcher didn't auto update. How do I fix this?</h3>
    <p>Press the Windows Key + R and paste the following:<br>
    <p><code>cmd.exe /c del "%localappdata%\Onix Launcher\OnixClient.dll" && pause</code></p>
    <p>This will delete the old Onix Client dll, and the launcher will install the new one on launch.</p><br><br>
    <h3>When I open the client, I get an error saying: <code>You are attempting to open a file of type "system file"</code>. Why does this happen?</h3>
    <p>This is because you are trying to open the DLL, which only works with other injectors. The DLL file cannot be opened and is not meant to be either. If you want to use this method please check out the Onix injector. If you use a third-party injector, we are not responsible for anything that might happen.</p><br><br> 
    <h3>Can I turn off or customize the "OnixClient on top!" splash text?</h3>
    <p>No. We use this to make diagnosing problems much easier for our support team.</p><br><br>
    <h3>When I inject, my game crashes. Why does this happen?</h3>
    <p>Your game is most likely on an unsupported version. If you are below 1.16.40, you will need to upgrade to a higher version. If you are above the latest supported version, you will need to downgrade. You can downgrade (or upgrade) using <a href="https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher">MCLauncher</a>.</p>

    <h3>Why does it say "as nobody (HOW)" on Discord instead of my Gamertag?</h3>
    <p>Make sure you have the Xbox Console Companion, which you can download <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-console-companion/9wzdncrfjbd8#activetab=pivot:overviewtab">here</a>. Log in, and it should show up after restarting the launcher.</p>
    <p>If you have already downloaded Xbox Console Companion, log out and log back in to fix it.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>I clicked Launch and I see the "OnixClient on top!" splash text. Now what?</h3>
    <p>Go to a world or server and press L or Insert, then you&#39;ll be able to see the Client Settings button. To activate modules, right-click on them.</p>
